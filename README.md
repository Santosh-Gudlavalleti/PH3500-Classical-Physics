# PH3500-Classical-Physics by Prof. S. Kasiviswanathan
The course deals with classical mechanics, thermodynamics of particles at micro and macro levels in various dimensions using the Lagrangian, Hamiltonian and other methods. A brief introduction was given on Quantum Physics.

A Simulation had to be made as a part of project, this simulation deals with: How wildlife population of a species are affected by various factors such Predators, Prey/Plants, Diseases etc and how in turn that affects the Predator's population. Various initial conditions have been considered and their stabilities have been analysed.
